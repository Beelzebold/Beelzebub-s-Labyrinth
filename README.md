# Beelzebub-s-Labyrinth

Have you ever wanted to just kick back, relax, and kill demons for a very, 
very long time? Well, now you can, I guess.
I made this over the course of... a while. it features a nice wave based 
progression system, which increases the number of monsters per wave as 
you go as well as the monster types, going from zeds, imps and pinkies 
to revenants, nobles, and archviles. it also changes the bonus loot you 
can get at the end of each wave.

just keep in mind, UV is 4 times harder than ITYTD. so, if you're playing 
with a mod that makes the game a bit harder to play, well, tone the 
difficulty down.
(note: corpses don't disappear, so on lower end systems they may cause lag 
and will be hard to see through.)
